This project serves the purpose of analyzing news using News API 
In the present scenario, the technology revisions are making the market vulnerable to predict. This gives birth to the requirement of a new model which can stop loss of a production business by predicting the market using news analysis, associative rule mining, precise predicting techniques and context analysis. This paper presents a novel idea of dealing with manufacturers' problem of product dump due to rapid change in technology and changing demand of customers. Every new product launched with new features or with existing features but less price gives a tough competition to already existing products in the market. By the time manufacturer comes to know that the demand has been decreased, the manufacturer is already in the loss and he has to dump already manufactured pieces due to rapid down-sale. In this paper, a model is proposed with an algorithm to quickly identify the required number of pieces in a time-frame.
